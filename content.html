    <pre>
        Before coming to college, we all have a certain set of expectations influenced by some external source.
        These sources can be media portrayals of college life
        or some exagerrated braggings from some friend who is already in a college.

    <h1>
        COLLEGE CAMPUS
    </h1>

    <pre class="con1">
        Imagined some majestic, Hogwarts kind of campus where it would be a struggle to even remember all the paths.
    </pre>

    <pre class="con2">
        We don't even have a permanent campus... and the one that we have ends almost as soon as it begins.
        But I guess that's understandable since IIITs are only for circuital branches.

    <pre class="con1">
        Assumed that college teachers would be super chill. They wouldn't care if students attend their classes or not.
        It would be perfectly normal to walk out of classes we don't want to attend.
    </pre>

    <pre class="con2">
        They care a little too much. It's like being in school all over again where teachers and assignments are hanging
        over your neck like some scythe.

    <h1>
        FREE TIME
    </h1>

    <pre class="con1">
        Believed that we'd get a LOT of free time to explore all domains.

        HOSTEL LIFE
    </h1>

    <img class="camp1" src="hostel1.jpg" alt="">

    <pre class="con1">
        Since I knew I had to get into a sarkari sort of college, my expectations were super low.
        Common washroom for entire floor, tiny rooms with at least three beds, poor infrastructure, etc.
    </pre>

    <img class="camp2" src="" alt="">

    <pre class="con2">
        Hostels here at IIIT-Ranchi are great (at least for first year). We like in flat like structures that
        are either 3 or 2 BHK with attached washrooms and balconies.
